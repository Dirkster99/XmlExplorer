UnitComboLib

The WPF UnitComboBox Control implements a combobox that allows the selection of values from different lists based on different units. Each list can represent a different unit (eg.: Celsius, Farenheit) and the viewmodel takes care of always converting to one unit (e.g. Celsius). This conversion is independent of what the user selected unit or value actually was.
