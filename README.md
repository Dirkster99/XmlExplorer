# XmlExplorer

![Screenshot](https://github.com/Dirkster99/XmlExplorer/blob/master/00_Docu/screenshot.png?raw=true)

The XmlExplorer is a clone from a CodePlex project back in 2009:
https://xmlexplorer.codeplex.com/

The GitHub project here applies the MVVM pattern and unlocks therefore
advanced theming and configuration features (re-usability patterns).

The project is currently in Alpha state (do NOT expext a fully developed
application), but the available refactoring is very interesting.

A tool for editing Xml is XmlNotepad
