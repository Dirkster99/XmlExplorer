# XmlExplorer

The XmlExplorer is a clone from a CodePlex project back in 2009:
https://xmlexplorer.codeplex.com/

The GitHub project here applies the MVVM pattern and unlocks therefore
advanced theming and configuration features (re-usability patterns).

The project is currently in Alpha state (do NOT expext a fully developed
application), but the available refactoring is very interesting.
